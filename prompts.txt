ChatGPT history how most of extension.ts was generated.

---
create vscode extension.ts which converts the selection(s) - add a helper function to reduce code duplication

      {
        "command": "text-utils.base64-encode",
        "title": "Base64 Encode"
      },
      {
        "command": "text-utils.base64-decode",
        "title": "Base64 Decode"
      },
      {
        "command": "text-utils.json-string-encode",
        "title": "JSON string encode"
      },
      {
        "command": "text-utils.json-string-decode",
        "title": "JSON string decode"
      },
      {
        "command": "text-utils.url-component-encode",

        "title": "XML entity encode"
      },
      {
        "command": "text-utils.xml-entity-decode",
        "title": "XML entity decode"
      }
---

is the edit builder safe with replacing with different length strings?
---

extend xml entity decode to also handle &#...; as well as optional semicolon
---

add more known named entities
---

add european acented characters
---

add decode function for email/eml mime strings which can be in a lot of different encodings - start with just utf8 and simple transforms
---

can these encoded blocks span multiple lines in the eml? not covered yet
---

does nodejs buffer support these charsets?
---

add iconv fallback
---

add tests for all conversions now
---

I exported my functions from the extensions so you don't have to reimplement them in the tests, use them:

base64Encode
base64Decode
xmlEntityEncode
xmlEntityDecode
mimeHeaderDecode
